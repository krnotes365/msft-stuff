# How to check Exam Result on Pearson VUE

Many Microsoft Exam test takers have reported about the confusion of how to check results, post their exam.  The process is definitely not user-friendly.  Here is the way, I found to check your all Exam Results History.

1. Visit any Exam Page. In this example, I am visiting <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/pl-100/" target="_blank">PL-100</a> exam page.
2. Click on the yellow colored **Schedule exam** button (*Please don't get scared, you don't have to actually pay and register*)
3. Go through the Exam Registration Process (Step 1 Profile, Step 2 Discounts, Step 3 Schedule Exam)
4. Click the **Schedule with Pearson VUE** button in the Step 3.
5. You will be transferred to Pearson VUE site now. The browser URL will look like something like this - "https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/registration/SelectExamOptionsPage/MICROSOFT?conversationId=XXXXXX"
6. *Optional* - expand the menu using ">>" in the left menu bar.
7. Click on **Org Chart** icon in the left menu, which will take you to the Pearson VUE Dashboard.
8. Here, you can find the "View score reports" at the right side.
